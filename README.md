**A collection of useful personal code chunks**

\- _sql-pivot-on-dynamic-number-of-columns.sql_: When you need to pivot around attributes whose quality and/or quantity can change

\- _Querying-T-SQL-Database-with-Python.py_: Name is explicit enough

\- _using-remote-APIs-to-treat-files-in-Python-example.py_: Name is explicit enough

\- _audio-files_cut-and-encode.py_: Name is explicit enough

\- _RNN-LSTM-NLP-Example.py_: A [Keras](https://keras.io/) based, configurable (number of hidden layers, dropout etc...) recurrent neural network (RNN), composed of long short term memory (LSTM) cells (neurons). Adapted for some natural language processing (NLP) purposes.
Note that if you wish to use Keras, I highly recommend you install it's [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/) backend first.

\- _3D-numpy-arrays-manipulations-examples_: Get inside axis logics and some conditional operations on numpy arrays of 3 dimensions

\- _Neural-Network-Sentiment-Analyses-2-Classes-With-Attention_: An interesting NLP "sentiment" classifier, originated from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/)'s contest "[Quora Insincere Questions Classification](https://www.kaggle.com/c/quora-insincere-questions-classification)"
